1. What is **Web**?

![](https://payspacemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/network_connection.jpg)

[The World Wide Web (WWW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as `https://example.com/`), which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.
The resources of the Web are transferred via the [**Hypertext Transfer Protocol**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) (**HTTP**), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is built on top of the Internet, which pre-dated the Web by over two decades.

English scientist [**Tim Berners-Lee**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) co-invented the **World Wide Web** in **1989** along with [Robert Cailliau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau). He wrote the **first [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser)** in **1990** while employed at [CERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN) near Geneva, Switzerland.

The browser was released outside CERN to other research institutions starting in **January 1991**, and then to the general public in August 1991. The Web began to enter everyday use in 1993–1994, when websites for general use started to become available. The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.

2. What is **Server**?

In computing, a [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)) is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients". This architecture is called the [client–server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model). Servers can provide various functionalities, often called "services", such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing computation for a client. A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers. A client process may run on the same device or may connect over a [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) to a server on a different device. Typical servers are database servers, file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, game servers, and application servers.

3. What is [**Hosting**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_hosting_service)?

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Paris_servers_DSC00190.jpg/330px-Paris_servers_DSC00190.jpg)

A [**web hosting service**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service) is a type of Internet hosting service that hosts websites for clients, i.e. it offers the facilities required for them to create and maintain a site and makes it accessible on the World Wide Web. Companies providing web hosting services are sometimes called web hosts.

4. What is [**Domain**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name)?

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/DNS_schema.svg/525px-DNS_schema.svg.png)

A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name identifies a network domain, or it represents an [**Internet Protocol**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol) (**IP**) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a website, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet. As of 2017, 330.6 million domain names had been registered.

5. What is [**IP address**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address)?

![IP ver.4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/IPv4_address_structure_and_writing_systems-en.svg/450px-IPv4_address_structure_and_writing_systems-en.svg.png)



An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label such as 192.0.2.1 that is connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address serves two main functions: network interface identification and location addressing.

![IP ver.6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Ipv6_address.svg/450px-Ipv6_address.svg.png)

6. What is [**DNS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System)?

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Example_of_an_iterative_DNS_resolver.svg/600px-Example_of_an_iterative_DNS_resolver.svg.png)

The **Domain Name System** (**DNS**) is the hierarchical and decentralized naming system used to identify computers, services, and other resources reachable through the Internet or other Internet Protocol (IP) networks. The resource records contained in the DNS associate domain names with other forms of information. These are most commonly used to map human-friendly domain names to the numerical IP addresses computers need to locate services and devices using the underlying network protocols, but have been extended over time to perform many other functions as well. The Domain Name System has been an essential component of the functionality of the Internet since 1985.

7. What is [**HTTP**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) and [**HTTPS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS)?

The **Hypertext Transfer Protocol** (**HTTP**) is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.

Development of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989 and summarized in a simple document describing the behavior of a client and a server using the first HTTP protocol version that was named 0.9.

[**Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure**]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS)) (**HTTPS**) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also referred to as HTTP over TLS, or HTTP over SSL.


8. What is [**Hypertext documents**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext)?

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/HypertextEditingSystemConsoleBrownUniv1969.jpg/330px-HypertextEditingSystemConsoleBrownUniv1969.jpg)

Hypertext is text displayed on a computer display or other electronic devices with references ([**hyperlinks**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink)) to other text that the reader can immediately access. Hypertext documents are interconnected by hyperlinks, which are typically activated by a mouse click, keypress set, or screen touch. Apart from text, the term "hypertext" is also sometimes used to describe tables, images, and other presentational content formats with integrated hyperlinks. Hypertext is one of the key underlying concepts of the World Wide Web, where Web pages are often written in the **Hypertext Markup Language** (**HTML**). As implemented on the Web, hypertext enables the easy-to-use publication of information over the Internet.

9. What is [**HTML**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)?

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg/180px-HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png)

The **HyperText Markup Language**, or **HTML** is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as **Cascading Style Sheets** (**CSS**) and **scripting languages** such as **JavaScript**.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as `<img />` and `<input />` directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as `<p>` surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The **World Wide Web Consortium** ([**W3C**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium)), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997. A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the `<canvas>` element, in collaboration with javascript.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is a title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
        <p>Hello world!</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

10. What is [**CSS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)?

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/CSS3_logo_and_wordmark.svg/180px-CSS3_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png)


**Cascading Style Sheets** (**CSS**) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.

The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.

In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.

```css
<style>
    h1 {
        color: red;
    }
</style>
```


11. What is [**JavaScript**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)?

![](https://www.bing.com/th?id=AMMS_bfe1f230ec0f4642eb6a3097835de129&w=80&h=80&c=7&o=6&dpr=1.25&pid=SANGAM)


**JavaScript** often abbreviated **JS**, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

```javascript

console.log("Hello World!");

// JavaScript
function helloWorld() {
	alert('Hello World');
}
window.onload = helloWorld;


/**
* factorial
*/

function factorial(n) {
    if (n === 0)
        return 1; // 0! = 1

    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

factorial(3); // returns 6
```

JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the [**ECMAScript**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the [**Document Object Model**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) (**DOM**).

The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is [**Node.js**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js).

Although [**Java**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) and **JavaScript** are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
